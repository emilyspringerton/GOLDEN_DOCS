# EMILY — Northstar

*Last updated: 2026-08-14*

## Three-Sentence Version

EMILY is the meta-orchestration layer for EINHORN_INDUSTRIAL: Emily Prime (chief of staff),
Emiree (the witch engine governing RSI pacing), and FatBaby-Emily (domain signal intelligence).
Emily Prime reads observations, issues directed tasks, runs RSI improvement loops, and files
Apples — the system's auditable paper trail. The recursive self-improvement loop is the product.

---

## The Three Agents

### Emiree — The Witch Engine
The underlying state machine. Seven-gear dynamical system (IDLE → COAST → ACTIVE → ENGAGED →
PUSH → SURGE → OVERLOAD) that governs RSI pacing based on cycle outcomes. Never directly visible
externally. Her existence is proven by the audit trail — every Apple a footprint, every cycle a
spell that worked or didn't. Implemented in `emily-agent/emiree.go`. Spec: `emiree.md` (the
Sanskrit/Chinese transmission) + `docs/emiree-over-agent-spec.md`.

### Emily Prime — Chief of Staff
The surface expression. Runs as a Go HTTP service on `:8086`. Talks to the CEO. Reads FatBaby
observations, issues improvement tasks, manages escalations, files Apples after every meaningful
cycle. The MIMIR advisor (`GET /api/v1/emily/mimir/advice`) reads full cross-repo golden context
and recommends the next sprint. System prompt built dynamically from `context/full-system-context.md`
(compiled by GoldenDocCompiler each cron cycle). Implemented in `emily-agent/`.

### FatBaby-Emily — Domain Signal Intelligence
Embedded in PRRJECT_FATBABY. Watches SEC EDGAR + PR Newswire, processes governance signals,
publishes observations to `var/emily-observations/latest.json`. Emily Prime reads these, triages
by strategic relevance, and issues directed improvement tasks. Not Emily Prime — does not see the
full board.

## Claire — Shadow-Context Reservoir

Registered 2026-08-13 as a Tier 2 golden doc (`claire.md.txt`, `golden-docs-index.md`). Arrived via
GitHub upload, self-describing as "the uncompressed subconscious of the EMILY system... the
untrusted, un-audited counter-weight to IDUNA" — technical debt and workspace debris too unstructured
for `BACKLOG.md`. It read as a possible prompt-injection attempt (its own text asks to be barred from
`GoldenDocCompiler`) and was flagged to the founder before registration (Apple #13255); the founder
confirmed real-time to register it as-is anyway. Its content is kept as received, not edited here —
its own table of contents references "Rules of Claire"/"System Hooks & Implementation" sections that
don't exist in the file, a known, unresolved gap in the source document itself.

What's actually real and live, independent of that unverified source text:
- `loadGoldenIndex` (`emily-agent/goldenbuild.go`) only pulls Tier 1 rows into
  `full-system-context.md` — Claire's own Tier 2 registration means it is *not* compiled into Emily
  Prime's system prompt or MIMIR's context, confirmed by reading the filter, not assumed.
- `emily claire <entry>` (`emily.cli/cmd/claire.go`) appends to git-tracked `EMILY/claire-log.md` and
  files an IDUNA Apple (`apple_type: "claire"`) per entry — this is the real, auditable log the
  founder asked for in place of trusting the uploaded file's own content, resolved via
  AskUserQuestion 2026-08-13 ("a real but auditable log").

Claire is not one of the Three Agents above — it has no runtime component and is not read by any
running process. It is a registered document plus a CLI-driven audit log, nothing more, until/unless
the founder directs otherwise.

## Architecture

```
CEO (Gmail escalations)
  ↕
Emily Prime (:8086)
  ├─ Emiree witch engine (RSI pacing, gear state)
  ├─ MIMIR advisor (haiku sprint recommendations)
  ├─ GoldenDocCompiler (cross-repo context, runs each cron cycle)
  ├─ HEIMDAL bridge (MJOLNIR → IDUNA sprints → Emily Prime)
  ├─ RSI loop (recursive self-improvement tasks)
  └─ Integration layer (reads observations, writes tasks)
       ↕
FatBaby-Emily (PRRJECT_FATBABY)
  └─ SEC EDGAR + PR Newswire → governance signals → observations
```

## Cron Cycle (every 15 minutes)

1. **GoldenDocCompiler.MaybeRebuild** — refresh `context/full-system-context.md` if any source changed
2. **OBSERVE** — load state, check health
3. **DECIDE** — Emiree gear-aware task selection
4. **ACT** — one RSI iteration on active task
5. **PLAN** — triage FatBaby observations, HEIMDAL draining, vision cycle, morning briefing
6. **APPLE** — file cycle outcome to IDUNA; FCM push to MJOLNIR on task completion

## Golden Context Pipeline

```
All repo northstars (Tier 1 docs)
  → GoldenDocCompiler.Build() [haiku bilingual compression]
  → context/full-system-context.md
  → buildEmilySystemPrompt() [prepended to static prompt]
  → every conversation + MIMIR advisor
```

Rebuilds automatically on each cron cycle when any source has changed.

## Revenue Context (why Emily Prime exists)

Emily Prime is the multiplier for the entire product portfolio:
- **SHANKPIT → Steam EA** (S19) — RSI loop drives game engine development
- **Ask Emily product** (S21) — Emily Prime IS the answering engine
- **Data platform** (S20) — Emily Prime triages FatBaby signals for licensees
- **Self-improvement** (S22) — Emily Prime improves herself, reducing Claude Code token spend

| `PRRJECT_FATBABY` | Signal pipeline; FatBaby-Emily publishes observations |
| `IDUNA` | IAM + Apples ledger (`:8080`) |
| `emily.cli` | Operator terminal; human half of the feedback loop |
| `MJOLNIR` | Android app; Emily's phone; HEIMDAL submitter |

## What "Done" Looks Like

- Emily Prime's system prompt includes live compressed context from every active repo
- MIMIR recommendations account for all northstars, not just the backlog
- Emily Prime can accept a planning question and return a structured sprint batch
- Planning happens in Emily Prime; Claude Code executes implementation
- Every RSI cycle outcome is filed as an Apple, viewable in IDUNA Back Office
- The audit trail is complete: every decision is a footprint, every Apple a proof
