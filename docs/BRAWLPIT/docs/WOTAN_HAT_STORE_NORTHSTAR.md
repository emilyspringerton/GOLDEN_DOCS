# NORTHSTAR — WOTAN Hat Store (BRAWLPIT cosmetics, paid in GFD Flow)

Real, unified scoping pass for 3 related priority-queue cards, treated as one feature, not three
separate asks: `WOTAN-999` ("we need to build the hat store WOTAN you can buy upgraded hats for
brawlpit using flow from GFD plan nortgstar it"), `WOTAN-998` ("IMPLEMENT vs0 GO... plan
nortgstar it"), `WOTAN-996` ("ITERATE... make it so users can draw their own hats in a pixel
editor"). Originally planning-only, per `WOTAN-999`'s own explicit "plan northstar it" framing —
**updated 2026-09-03**: Phases 0 and 1 are now real and shipped, see below.

## What's actually being asked, made concrete

A cosmetic store, hosted on WOTAN (the real, existing esports/stats hub at
`okemily.com/tournaments.html` — confirmed via prior BACKLOG history to be a real web page, not
its own separate codebase), where a player spends **Flow** (GFD's own real, existing in-game
currency) to buy hats their BRAWLPIT fighter can wear. `WOTAN-996` adds a real pixel editor so
players can draw their own custom hats instead of only picking from a pre-made catalog.

## Real, checked-live foundation — what already exists

- **Flow is real and already live**, but ONLY inside GFD's own MUD server: `GoblinFoxDragon/
  apps2/mud/main.go`'s own `Player.flow` field, already used for real buy/sell/travel-cost
  mechanics (`"You buy %s for %d flow"`, `"Need %d Flow to travel"`). Real, honest, decisive
  finding: **there is no external API exposing a player's Flow balance today** — it only exists
  as in-process server state inside the MUD's own player struct.
- **This exact gap is already named, separately, twice, elsewhere in this backlog** — kanban
  cards `3213432` ("build flow API bindings into papercraft... IDUNA game accounts dont have game
  boundaries so we can use flow from GFD") and `345234` ("build more api mod interfaces to allow
  more programatic access to the flow market in GFD"). **Real, load-bearing consequence for this
  doc**: the hat store's own real prerequisite — a way to check and spend a player's Flow balance
  from OUTSIDE the GFD MUD process — is not a new problem this feature invents, it's the SAME
  real, already-tracked gap those two cards name. This doc does not re-plan that work; it names
  the dependency directly so the hat store isn't built twice against two different, disconnected
  assumptions about how Flow access will eventually work.
- **BRAWLPIT is real and live**: a real 2.5D fighter, 10 real fighters, a real character-select
  screen (`apps/lobby`) — the real, concrete place a "wearing a hat" cosmetic would actually
  render.
- **IDUNA is the real, existing identity boundary** every cross-game system in this monorepo
  already uses — a player's WOTAN session, GFD Flow balance, and BRAWLPIT hat inventory all need
  to resolve to the SAME real IDUNA identity, not three separate account systems.

## Real, phased plan

**Phase 0 — DONE, real, already existed (corrected 2026-09-03).** This doc originally named "a
real Flow balance-query + spend API" as a blocking external prerequisite, matching kanban cards
`3213432`/`345234`'s own framing. Checked directly while building Phase 1 below: it already
exists, and did not need new work. `apps2/mud/main.go`'s own `runHeadlessCommand` already syncs
every real Flow delta to IDUNA's `characters.gold_balance` column via `idunaclient.CreditGold`/
`DeductGold` on each headless-command tick. IDUNA's own `GET /api/v1/characters/by-player/:id`
already returns that `gold_balance` (its own doc comment already called this "a real, WOTAN
player_id" resolution route), and `PATCH /api/v1/characters/:id/gold` already spends it
atomically (409 on insufficient funds) — the exact real balance-query + spend contract this
doc asked for. Real, honest caveat: the sync only happens on a headless-command tick, so a
read could be stale if a player hasn't issued a MUD command recently — a real, secondary
refinement, not a blocker for Phase 1/2. Cards `3213432`/`345234` may still have real, separate
asks (cross-game currency swaps with GTA7, broader mod-interface access) — this correction is
scoped to the hat store's own narrow need, not a claim those cards are fully resolved.

**Phase 1 — DONE, real hat catalog + inventory data model (shipped 2026-09-03).** Real home:
IDUNA's own existing MMO schema (`IDUNA/migrations/truestore`), matching `characters`/`items`/
`character_equipment`'s own established convention directly — not `IDUNA_PRO` as an earlier
draft of this doc guessed (`IDUNA_PRO` is a separate, newer product extraction unrelated to
GFD/BRAWLPIT's own MMO backend). New `hats` (hat_id, name, description, flow_cost, image_asset)
+ `character_hats` (character_id, hat_id, acquired_at, equipped) tables
(`202609030001_hats.sql`), seeded with a real, hand-curated 6-hat catalog drawn directly from
`OKEMILY/hats.html`'s own already-designed mockup (not invented fresh) — Top Hat/Uncrowned's
Doubt/Joystick Cap/Second Growth Wreath/Scavenger's Vest Cap/Most-Summoned Circlet, each
lore-grounded in an already-tuned BRAWLPIT character. New handlers
(`IDUNA/internal/http/handlers/hats.go`): `GET /api/v1/hats` (catalog), `GET /api/v1/characters/
:id/hats` (owned), `POST /api/v1/characters/:id/hats/buy` (atomic Flow-deduct + ownership grant
in one real DB transaction, reusing `handleDeductGold`'s own conditional-UPDATE pattern), `PATCH
/api/v1/characters/:id/hats/equip` (exclusive single-hat equip). Real bug found and fixed
live, test-driven: the buy handler's own "character not found vs. insufficient funds"
disambiguation query ran on `h.DB` instead of the open `tx`, which for a `:memory:` SQLite test
DB lands on a different, empty connection — always misreporting a real character as "not
found." 8 real tests (catalog list+cost-ordering, successful buy, insufficient-Flow rejection,
duplicate-purchase rejection with a real rollback-doesn't-double-spend assertion, unknown-hat
404, owned-hats listing, exclusive equip-swap, equip-not-owned rejection) plus a real migration
test confirming the MySQL-flavored DDL survives the SQLite translation path intact (apostrophes,
`TINYINT(1)`, composite primary keys) and re-applies idempotently. `go build/vet/test ./...`
clean.

**Phase 2 — LIVE and end-to-end verified (updated 2026-09-07).** `WOTAN/store.html`: real email/
password IDUNA login (`/api/v1/auth/email/login`+`/register`, JWT in localStorage), resolves the
logged-in player's own GFD character, browses the real hat catalog, shows Flow cost, buys and
equips hats against Phase 1's own real endpoints -- calling them through a new same-origin
`/api/` proxy in `WOTAN/ops/nginx-wotan.conf` (matching `OKEMILY`'s own proxy convention) so the
browser needs no CORS/cross-origin bearer-token handling. Linked from `WOTAN/index.html`. Found
and fixed a real, separate security gap while scoping this: `handleBuyHat`/`handleEquipHat` had
no ownership check at all, letting any authenticated player spend a different player's own Flow
-- see `IDUNA/CHANGELOG.md`'s 2026-09-04 (2) entry.
**Real, decisive correction to this doc's own prior status**: `WOTAN-DNS-001`'s sudo-queue setup
(`sudo-queue/48-setup-wotan-nginx-and-dir.sh`) has since been run -- `wotan.okemily.com` is live
(`curl -I` returns a real `200`), and this pass live-verified the actual API path end to end
against the running `iduna.service`: registered a real test player
(`POST /api/v1/auth/email/register`), confirmed `GET /api/v1/hats` returns the real 6-hat
catalog through the WOTAN proxy with a real Bearer JWT, and confirmed the expected "no
DragonsNShit character for this player_id" response for a brand-new WOTAN signup with no GFD
character yet (correct, not a bug -- Flow lives on a `characters` row, so a hat purchase
requires a real GFD character to exist first). This doc's own prior "not yet done: no live/
browser verification is possible" is now stale; the previously-scoped blocker has been cleared.

**Phase 2.5 — DONE, real GFD Town proxy (kanban `WTHS-012010`, shipped 2026-09-03).** A real,
separate real purchase surface, in parallel with the eventual WOTAN web page above, not a
replacement for it: a new `hatshop`/`hatshop buy <hat-id>`/`hatshop mine` MUD command in
`GoblinFoxDragon/apps2/mud/main.go` calls Phase 1's own real endpoints directly (new
`server/idunaclient.ListHats`/`BuyHat`/`ListCharacterHats`), letting a player buy a real
BRAWLPIT hat with real Flow from inside GFD's own Town, no separate web login needed (the MUD
session's own already-resolved IDUNA character identity carries through). Real, live,
end-to-end verified: redeployed the live IDUNA instance (it predated Phase 1's own commit),
then bought a real hat as the real `DRAGONSNSHIT-MUD` agent, confirmed ownership, confirmed a
duplicate purchase correctly fails. GFD commit `dafccba`.

**Phase 3 — real BRAWLPIT-side affordances. Design resolved 2026-09-07, founder real-time; not
yet built.** "Including affordances on the brawlpit side (optional login screen on the hat
selection screen give a blue and a red hat and a green hat to choose from in addition to any
hats the user has unlocked)." This resolves the design question this doc previously left open:

- The hat-selection screen (`STATE_CHARACTER_SELECT` in `apps/lobby/src/main.c`) always offers
  **3 free, local, no-login-required hats**: Blue, Red, Green -- plain solid-color cosmetics
  needing no network call at all, so a player who never touches WOTAN/IDUNA still gets a real
  cosmetic choice.
- **Login is optional**, not required, on that same screen -- a player who chooses to log in
  (real IDUNA email/password auth, same flow `WOTAN/store.html` already uses) additionally sees
  whatever real hats they've unlocked via the store (Phase 1's own `GET /api/v1/characters/:id/
  hats`), mixed into the same selection list as the 3 free ones.

**Free 3-hat picker -- SHIPPED (2026-09-07).** `apps/lobby/src/main.c`'s `STATE_CHARACTER_SELECT`
screen now offers No Hat/Blue/Red/Green per player slot via Up/Down (keyboard or pad d-pad/left-
stick), rendered as a solid-color brim+crown above each fighter using the screen's own existing
`draw_rect` primitive -- no new asset/texture pipeline needed for a flat-color swatch (new
`draw_hat()` helper, new `selected_hat[2]` state matching `selected_chars`'s own per-player-slot
convention). Wired into both of this screen's two structurally-identical update/render blocks
(one event-driven, one per-frame) to stay consistent with this file's own existing pattern of
needing every character-select input applied twice. `scripts/build.sh` compiles clean (client +
server + the full physics smoke test suite, all passing); a headless run
(`SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`) starts and runs without crashing.

**In-match rendering -- SHIPPED (2026-09-07).** The "attach a cosmetic layer onto a fighter
sprite DURING A MATCH" point this doc previously called an open technical question turned out to
already exist: `draw_player()` already had a real "mirror-match hat" (a bright pom-pom/triangle
disambiguating a same-character mirror match), drawn last, above the head, in local
player-model space -- the exact attach point a real cosmetic needs. `selected_hat[]` now renders
there in `STATE_GAME_LOCAL` matches, taking priority over the generic mirror-match indicator (a
real hat already disambiguates a mirror match on its own, no need to show both). Deliberately
gated to `STATE_GAME_LOCAL` + `player_index < 2`: `selected_hat` holds this machine's own local
character-select choices, which has no protocol-synced meaning for a remote opponent in a
networked match (`STATE_GAME_NET`, up to `MAX_CLIENTS` players) -- applying it unconditionally
would either show the wrong player's hat or read past the 2-element array. Verified:
`scripts/build.sh` clean (client + server + full physics smoke test suite), `gcc -Wall -Wextra`
clean on the new code, headless run (`SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`) starts without crashing.

Not built: the IDUNA HTTP client call from the native client (a real, new capability --
`apps/lobby` has no HTTP client today, only the game's own UDP protocol to `apps/server`) needed
for the "any hats the user has unlocked" half of the founder's own ask, and syncing a hat choice
across `STATE_GAME_NET` (real, separate, not attempted -- named above). Real, honest scope note:
the IDUNA login piece is native game-client engineering (SDL2 UI + a new network dependency on
IDUNA, distinct from the game's own UDP protocol), sized for its own dedicated pass.

**Phase 4 (`WOTAN-996`'s own real ask) — a real pixel editor for user-drawn hats.** A real,
simple, canvas-based pixel-art editor on the WOTAN page itself (the natural home — it's already
where the store lives), producing a real image asset a player can submit alongside Phase 1's own
catalog. Real, honest, deliberately-named open questions, not resolved here: **moderation** (a
public pixel editor producing player-visible in-game content needs a real content-review step
before publishing wide — the same real class of question `EMILY_FOR_BUSINESS_NORTHSTAR.md`'s own
self-signup/abuse-policy question already named for a different feature), and **a real cost
model** for a user-drawn hat (a flat Flow price? free, since the player did the work? — a real,
founder-level product decision, not resolved here).

**Phase 4.5 (kanban `BPHS-00001`) — a real "surprise box": spend Flow, get an AI-generated hat.
Scoped here, not built.** Real, distinct alternative to Phase 4's own pixel editor — instead of a
player drawing a hat by hand, they spend a real, large Flow amount and the box itself generates
one via the real, now-proven `promptoverse hat` style (`HSG-000`, see `emily.cli/CHANGELOG.md`:
`emily promptoverse add <subject> --tag "promptoverse hat"` already generates and publishes a
real standalone hat image end to end, live-verified with `pirate`). Real, checked prerequisites
this phase can build on directly: the `hats`/`character_hats` tables (Phase 1), the real Flow
spend path (`handleBuyHat`'s own atomic-transaction pattern), and the GFD Town proxy (Phase 2.5).

**Real design resolved 2026-09-04, founder direct clarification (kanban `HS-GFD-2223`)**: "a
surprise box does not need to generate the image at the time of purchase, it needs to get
generated when the player uses the item in GFD — it is actually like a tradable token." This
directly resolves the synchronous-purchase gap named below: the box itself is a real GFD item
(spend Flow → hold a real, tradable "Surprise Box" token in inventory, same real shape every
other GFD shop item already has — no slow generation anywhere near the purchase transaction).
The slow promptoverse generation only happens later, at USE time, which can be genuinely
async without blocking a purchase or holding a DB transaction open.

Real, concrete gaps this phase still needs to close, named honestly, not solved here:
- **The MUD server (`apps2/mud`) has no real background-job runner.** A synchronous "use box"
  command handler can't block for 35-140+ seconds waiting on a real generation call without
  stalling that player's whole connection (and, depending on the server's own concurrency model,
  possibly others). Needs a real, new async shape: "use box" kicks off the generation in a
  goroutine (`os/exec` calling the already-proven `emily promptoverse add <subject> --tag
  "promptoverse hat"`), tells the player it's in progress, and a real completion callback grants
  the resulting hat once done — matching the same real "request now, check back later" shape
  `emily promptoverse add`'s own queue already uses, not inventing a new one.
- **DONE (shipped 2026-09-07)**: real "create a hat row + grant it" endpoint. New migration
  `IDUNA/migrations/truestore/202609070002_hats_user_generated.sql` adds `user_generated`/
  `generated_by_character_id` to `hats`. New `POST /api/v1/characters/:id/hats/generated`
  (`IDUNA/internal/http/handlers/hats.go`'s `handleGenerateHat`) inserts a brand-new `hats` row
  (`flow_cost=0` -- Flow was already spent buying the box itself) AND grants it to the using
  character's own `character_hats`, in one real transaction. **Agent-only** (same
  "level/job updates are agent-only" pattern `mmo.go` already establishes) -- a plain player JWT
  is rejected with 403, closing the obvious free-hat-creation exploit a player-callable version
  would otherwise be. 2 new tests (agent JWT creates+grants; plain player JWT rejected, no hat
  row created at all). `go build/vet/test ./...` clean. Live-verified end to end against the
  running `iduna.service`: minted a real `DRAGONSNSHIT-MUD` agent token, called the endpoint
  against a real character, confirmed the new hat row (`user_generated=1`, correct
  `generated_by_character_id`) and the real `character_hats` grant row both landed, then cleaned
  up the test data. Still real, honest, NOT done: the MUD-side async job runner that would
  actually call this on generation completion (below), and the box item itself.
- **What subject does the box actually generate?** Not decided here — options include a random
  word from a curated pool, the player's own character name, or a themed pool tied to whichever
  BRAWLPIT character is equipped. A real, founder-level product/flavor decision.
- **"inflation sync" (the card's own literal phrase) is unexplained.** Read most plausibly as
  "the box's own Flow cost should scale as GFD's real Flow supply grows, so a fixed price doesn't
  become trivially affordable over time" — a real, reasonable economic design instinct, but not
  something this session found an existing "Flow supply" metric to key off of; a real, separate
  scoping question for whoever picks this phase up, not resolved by guessing here.
- **Moderation carries over from Phase 4 unchanged**: an AI-generated hat from an arbitrary
  player-chosen (or player-name-derived) subject is still real, public, player-visible content —
  the same real review-step question Phase 4 already named, not solved by generating it via AI
  instead of a pixel editor.
- **New `hats` table column needed**: today's `hats` rows are all hand-curated (Phase 1's own
  fixed 6-hat seed); a generated hat needs at minimum a `user_generated` flag and the real
  generating character's own ID, so the catalog can tell curated and player-generated hats apart
  (for display, moderation queueing, and any future "only see hats you personally unlocked"
  filtering) — real schema work, not attempted here.

## Real, honest, explicitly out-of-scope for this pass

Phases 0-1 and 2.5 shipped (see above); Phase 2 is code-complete but not yet live (blocked on
`WOTAN-DNS-001`'s own deploy, not on this feature's own code); Phases 3, 4, and 4.5 not built
(4.5 is scoped, not implemented). BRAWLPIT's own real
cosmetic-layer rendering mechanism (Phase 3) is still a real, unresolved technical question, not
designed. Cards `3213432`/`345234`'s own broader asks
(cross-game currency swaps, general mod-interface access beyond this specific hat-store need)
are not resolved by Phase 0's correction above — only the narrow Flow-balance-query-and-spend
need this feature has.
