# NORTHSTAR — DUNG (the BURROW editor)

## Where this came from, corrected twice in real time

Founder real-time, 2026-08-30, immediately after BURROW's own Phase 1/2 (lexer + parser parity)
shipped:

> "ok and rewrite pitviper and the parena editor into burrow" → "call it DUNG" → "aka the burrow
> editor" → "and terminal emulator" → "terminal emulator comes down as a visor" → "and there is
> also split pane use i3 primatives" → "like the editor and the terminal in the same window and
> then we like slurp in another file via drag another file onto it or load it from internet it
> opens up a new chat window inside the shared window" → "EMILY os design primatives ux and
> affordances"

**This project's own first scoping pass (written as `BURROW/DUNG.md`, in the BURROW repo) was
corrected directly, twice, in immediate follow-up**:

> "release DUNG as its own repo bazel built parena from the ground up port of parena editor" →
> "that uses burrow" → "use the real burrow cli to build the product"

**Real, corrected scope**: DUNG is its own standalone, real repo (this one — the founder had
already created the real, empty upstream `github.com/emilyspringerton/DUNG.git` before the
correction, same real "upstream created ahead of the ask" pattern `BURROW`'s own repo followed).
Built with **Bazel** (matching PARENA's own real build-system convention, not BURROW's own plain
`go.mod`). The editor half is a **ground-up port of PARENA's own real `stdlib/editor/*.prn`**,
written as real, fresh PARENA source living in this repo — not primarily hand-written Go with
PARENA as a secondary aid, the way BURROW's own `lexer.go`/`parser.go` hand-ports were. **DUNG
uses BURROW**: its own real build process compiles that PARENA source via the real `burrow` CLI
(BURROW's own Go+PARENA reimplementation of `parena-c`), not the original C-based `parena-c`
directly — DUNG is BURROW's own real, live, flagship dogfooding consumer.

**Scoping only, this pass.** No DUNG code exists yet.

## Real, explicit non-goal: PITVIPER itself is untouched

Same real precedent named in this project's own first draft, unchanged by the repo move:
**`PITVIPER`'s own Go implementation stays exactly as-is** — DUNG is a new, separate rewrite, not
a rewrite-in-place of the existing repo. The same real pattern `SAND` already set relative to
`PITVIPER` (`/home/fatbaby/CLAUDE.md`'s own SAND row), applied here a second time.

## What DUNG actually is

A single, real, unified application combining:

1. **A real terminal emulator** — the real successor to `PITVIPER`'s own SDL2 terminal (PTY
   handling, glyph rendering, vterm/scrollback). One real, new UX requirement named directly by
   the founder: **it comes down as a visor** — a real, quake-style drop-down overlay (the same
   real UX `Guake`/`Yakuake`/`Tilda` already establish), not a plain, permanently-windowed
   terminal.
2. **A real editor** — the real, ground-up PARENA-native successor to PARENA's own real
   `stdlib/editor/*.prn` (buffer management, TextMate-based syntax highlighting + theming, a
   Vim-modal keybinding model, a Spotlight/`Ctrl+T` command palette with a real, hot-swappable
   plugin-backend API, a reusable widget system) — real, substantial, already-designed logic
   this project ports forward, not started from a blank page.
3. **A real, shared, i3-primitive split-pane layout system** — the founder's own explicit
   correction over `PITVIPER/docs/NORTHSTAR.md`'s own existing, real, but different Milestone 3
   plan (vim-style `Ctrl+W |`/`Ctrl+W -` splits). DUNG's own real pane model follows i3's own real
   tiling primitives instead: a tree of containers, each one real, binary horizontal-or-vertical
   split, panes and splits nested arbitrarily, real focus movement between panes in the tree. One
   shared layout system serves BOTH the terminal panes and the editor panes.

## Why this is architecturally coherent, not a forced merger

Checked before writing this doc, not assumed: `PITVIPER` and PARENA's own editor **already share
the identical real technical foundation** — `PARENA/stdlib/editor/ui.prn`'s own header comment
states it directly: "gutter/diagnostics/status-bar/popups... render via sdl2's own real
primitives..., same architecture as PITVIPER's own SDL2 terminal-emulator precedent, not a new
toolkit." Both are already SDL2-based; `PARENA/stdlib/editor/events.prn`'s own header comment
cites PITVIPER's own real "ConPTY + mouse-drag-selection + clipboard" work as its own
architecture's precedent directly. DUNG isn't inventing a merger between two unrelated things —
it's the real, natural next step of two things that were already converging.

## Real UX foundation — adopted directly, not invented (`EmilyOS/docs/legacy-archive/gui-v0.1-design-capture.md`)

Founder real-time: "EMILY os design primatives ux and affordances." Found a direct, real match
before writing anything new: `EmilyOS/docs/legacy-archive/gui-v0.1-design-capture.md` is a
complete, already-written GUI v0.1 spec whose own layout model is explicitly named **"tmux × i3
hybrid"** — predating and directly matching the founder's own "use i3 primitives" instruction.
Adopted as DUNG's own real, authoritative UX foundation directly, not re-derived. The real,
load-bearing pieces (full detail in that doc):

- **Visual system**: a real, hard-coded palette — deep navy/near-black background, EGSHELL
  (white-ish) reserved exclusively for directory/container tiles, colored (never white) button
  tiles darker than EGSHELL, all-caps blocky typography, single-shot (never looping) activation
  flashes only.
- **Interaction contract — no single-click actions, ever**: a real, deterministic **fast
  double-click (≤220ms) activates**, a real, deterministic **slow double-click (350-800ms) enters
  label-edit mode**. Real, exact timing thresholds already specified, not left to be invented.
- **Layout — the real "tmux × i3 hybrid" panes**: the screen is a real tiling space; panes hold a
  directory view, a file view, a process/log panel, or a command-line/verb-bar panel; real
  keyboard-first pane operations. No freeform dragging by default.
- **Safety/posture hooks, real and already EmilyOS-integrated**: postures
  (`NORMAL`/`SIEGE`/`MERCY`/`INCIDENT`/`GAME`, `EmilyOS/internal/posture/`) gate which actions are
  AVAILABLE, never the visuals; a denied action gets a real, quiet, one-frame "deny flash" —
  explicitly no modal dialogs, no toast notifications. Real, direct relevance: EmilyOS is already
  named as PITVIPER's own real, related repo ("PITVIPER is the operator interface" per EmilyOS's
  own CLAUDE.md) — DUNG inheriting this same posture-aware interaction contract is a real,
  natural continuation, not a new one being forced.

**Real, new addition, reconciled with the original spec's own real "no freeform dragging by
default" rule**: "like the editor and the terminal in the same window and then we like slurp in
another file via drag another file onto it or load it from internet it opens up a new chat window
inside the shared window" — confirms DUNG is one real, shared window, and names a real, new pane
TYPE the original EmilyOS spec doesn't yet have: a **chat pane** (the real Emily Prime pane
`PITVIPER`'s own `docs/NORTHSTAR.md` already plans as its own Milestone 4), opened by dragging a
file onto the DUNG window OR loading one from a URL — the dropped/loaded file becomes that new
chat pane's own real, scoped context. A real, explicit verb-shaped action, not silently violating
the original spec's own no-casual-drag default.

## Real architecture: Bazel, ground-up PARENA editor, Go for what PARENA genuinely can't do yet

Real, corrected split (see "Where this came from" above):

- **PARENA, ground-up, primary** for the editor domain: a real, fresh port of `PARENA/stdlib/
  editor/*.prn`'s own real logic (buffer manipulation, TextMate tokenization + theming rules, the
  Spotlight fuzzy-match/plugin-dispatch algorithm, the widget system's own state transitions,
  i3-primitive split-pane tree logic) — written as real `.prn` source living in this repo, not a
  hand-port fallback.
- **The real `burrow` CLI is this project's own compiler toolchain** — `DUNG`'s own Bazel build
  invokes the real `burrow` binary (`BURROW`, this same session's own Go+PARENA reimplementation
  of `parena-c`) to compile that PARENA source, not the original C-based `parena-c`. **Corrected,
  same day**: this doc originally named `burrow build` reporting "not yet implemented" as a real,
  current blocker (`BURROW`'s own Phase 3-4 — region analyzer + emitter parity — not started yet).
  That blocker cleared the same day it was written: `BURROW`'s own Phase 3-4 shipped with a real,
  gcc-verified end-to-end proof (`burrow build` against PAPERCRAFT's own real
  `stdlib/papercraft/level_mod.prn`, compiled and run for real, all assertions passing —
  `BURROW/NORTHSTAR.md` Phase 3-4, `EMILY/BACKLOG.md` S206-88, Apple #17060). DUNG's own Phase 0
  ("unblock the real toolchain") is real, now, not still pending — Phase 1/2 below are unblocked.
- **Go, real and direct, for what SDL2/PTY genuinely need** (matching `PITVIPER`'s own
  already-proven real stack — SDL2 window/event-loop/renderer via cgo, FreeType2 glyph rendering,
  PTY via `openpty(3)`, the vterm/scrollback state machine): real, substantial systems-level
  plumbing no PARENA target has ever attempted, and not the ground-up-PARENA-port's own real
  scope (that's the editor domain specifically). This Go layer is the real host DUNG's own
  PARENA-compiled editor logic runs inside — the same real "PARENA owns the decision logic, host
  code owns the plumbing" split every mod in this monorepo already uses.

## Real scale, honestly

- `PITVIPER`: **4066+ real lines of already-working Go** — `cmd/pitviper/main.go` (689 lines),
  `internal/vterm` (842 lines + 555 lines of tests), `internal/pty`, `internal/font` (218 lines +
  emoji/shiny variants), `internal/gfdapi` (235 lines), `internal/mudconn`, `internal/scrollmod`.
- PARENA's editor: **13 real `.prn` files** (`buffer`/`render`/`spotlight`/`textmate`/
  `textmate_markdown`/`textmate_parena`/`textmate_loader`/`theme`/`ui`/`widget`/`plugin`/`events`/
  `construct_split`) plus a real, already-built `editor-demo` binary in the PARENA repo.
- **A full rewrite of both, in one sitting, is not realistic** — the same honest scale assessment
  `BURROW/NORTHSTAR.md` already makes for the compiler rewrite itself. This doc's own real job is
  scoping the real shape and the real first slice, not claiming a finished design.

## Real, phased plan

**DUNG Phase 0 — unblock the real toolchain — real, cleared (2026-08-30).** Was gated on
`BURROW`'s own Phase 3-4 (region analyzer + emitter parity) landing enough real emit capability
for `burrow build` to produce something runnable from real `.prn` source. That landed the same
day, gcc-verified end to end (see "Where this came from" above) — Phase 1 below is real, current
work now, not still blocked on a separate track.

**DUNG Phase 1 — the real, smallest proof point — real, shipped (2026-08-30).** A real SDL2
window (Go host, `cmd/dung/main.go`) that (a) renders a visor-style drop-down terminal pane (PTY +
vterm, vendored verbatim from `PITVIPER`'s own real, already-working `internal/vterm`/
`internal/pty`/`internal/font` into DUNG's own `internal/`, package names/APIs kept identical —
the terminal domain doesn't wait on BURROW's own emitter work, since it's Go-hosted, not
PARENA-compiled), and (b) can split that one pane into two via a real i3-primitive binary
container tree (`splitVertical`/`splitHorizontal`, Ctrl+Shift+Enter/Ctrl+Shift+O, Alt+Arrow
focus-cycling) — matching the same "smallest real proof point" discipline every other real Phase
0/1 in this monorepo already follows. No editor pane yet, per this phase's own real scope.

**Real, verified proof, not just written**: `go build`/`go vet`/`go test` clean across all four
packages (`cmd/dung`, `internal/vterm`, `internal/pty`, `internal/font` — `go test`: font +
vterm's own already-existing PITVIPER test suites pass unmodified, plus new
`cmd/dung/split_test.go` covering the split-tree logic itself: `leaves` traversal order,
`replaceNode` at root and inside a container, `nextFocus` forward/backward cycling and wraparound).
Ran for real under Xvfb (`--show` flag added for exactly this: headless/scripted verification with
no way to send the real F12 toggle) — a real bash spawned via a real PTY, its real colored SGR
prompt (`user@host:cwd$`) rendered correctly through the vterm→font→SDL2 pipeline, screenshot
captured, process stable, no panics. **Real, honest, named simplifications, not solved here**: F12
only fires while the window already has focus (a true global hotkey needs X11 `XGrabKey`, outside
what SDL2's own event loop gives for free); `nextFocus` is visit-order cycling, not geometric
nearest-neighbor. Bazel build scaffolded (`MODULE.bazel` + per-package `BUILD.bazel`, bzlmod
`rules_go`/`gazelle`/`go_deps.from_file`) and iterated on for real against three real, distinct
failures, not abandoned at the first one: (1) `rules_go` 0.50.1/`gazelle` 0.39.1 against the
installed Bazel 9.2.0 hit a removed `CcInfo` symbol — fixed by bumping to `rules_go` 0.63.0/
`gazelle` 0.53.0; (2) gazelle's own internal `go_repository_tools` fetch runs a real `go build`
that auto-discovers `/home/fatbaby/go.work` (the monorepo root's own workspace file, `go 1.25.0`)
by walking up the directory tree — `--repo_env=GOWORK=off` didn't suppress that discovery for
this specific internal fetch, so the downloaded SDK version itself had to satisfy the parent
`go.work`'s own floor; fixed by bumping `go_sdk.download` to `1.25.0`. **Real, still-open blocker,
found precisely, not glossed over**: `go-sdl2`'s own `#cgo pkg-config: sdl2` directive doesn't
resolve inside Bazel's sandboxed cgo compile action — `fatal error: SDL.h: No such file or
directory` compiling `sdl_wrapper.h`, even though `pkg-config --cflags sdl2` resolves fine on the
host and the identical code builds clean under plain `go build`. This is a real, separate rabbit
hole from Phase 1's own functional proof (which is complete and verified via `go build`, above) —
wiring a system C library's cgo flags into `rules_go`'s hermetic sandbox (via explicit `copts`/
`cdeps` on a patched `go_repository` entry, or a `cc_library` wrapping the system SDL2 install) is
real, scoped, later work, not solved here.

**DUNG Phase 2 — the real first ground-up PARENA editor slice**, gated on Phase 0: port
`stdlib/editor/buffer.prn`'s own real logic first (the most foundational real editor domain,
everything else depends on it), compiled via `burrow build`, real end-to-end proof that the
BURROW→DUNG toolchain relationship actually works.

**DUNG Phase 3+ (design only, not detailed here)**: TextMate highlighting, Spotlight, the plugin
API, the chat pane, Emily Prime integration (matching `PITVIPER`'s own already-planned
Milestone 4).

## Real scoping pass: PE macro recording (2026-09-14, moved here from NOCK's backlog)

Founder: "the parena editor will even allow us to program macros repeatable written in parena."
This card (`EMILY/BACKLOG.md` S416-07) had been filed under NOCK's own SECTION 416 purely because
it was bundled in the same founder quote as the "PE replaces `internal/nock/imagemagick.go`" idea
(S416-05) — checked directly and confirmed a mis-home: "PE" (the PARENA Editor) is this project,
DUNG, not `IDUNA/internal/nock`. `NOCK_NORTHSTAR.md` itself already says "no macro/scripting layer
exists anywhere in `internal/nock` yet" — correct, because it was never NOCK's to build. Re-scoped
here instead, against DUNG's own real, already-designed editor primitives, not started as code.

**The real hook already exists, unbuilt.** `PARENA/stdlib/editor/events.prn`'s `subscribe` +
`EditorEvent` (`OnKeybind`/`OnDragDrop`/`OnPaste`/`OnSave`/`OnChange`) and `plugin.prn`'s
`register-command` are exactly the two primitives a macro layer needs — recording taps the same
event stream a plugin would subscribe to; playback re-invokes the same named commands a plugin
would register. No new PARENA-side vocabulary needs inventing; this is a consumer of what's
already designed, not a new subsystem.

**The founder's own literal framing is the real constraint, not a suggestion**: a macro is
*written in PARENA* — real `.prn` source, not a proprietary binary/JSON macro format. So:

- **Recording** = while armed, append each dispatched `(OnKeybind ...)`/command invocation as a
  real PARENA call expression to a growing buffer; "stop recording, name it" emits a real
  `(defn record-<name> [] : Unit (command-a) (command-b) ...)` into a `.prn` file DUNG owns
  (e.g. `macros/<name>.prn`) — a macro IS a `.prn` source file, inspectable and hand-editable like
  any other, matching the founder's own words exactly.
- **Playback — the one real open design question, named honestly, not solved here**: DUNG's own
  current real pipeline (Phase 2+) compiles `.prn` → Go via `burrow build` at BUILD time, then
  links it into the binary (`internal/burrowgen`, per "Real Go mod wired in" above). A macro
  recorded during a live session can't wait for a recompile-and-relink cycle to become runnable —
  that's real, bad UX for something meant to feel like "record, then replay." Two real paths, not
  yet chosen between:
  1. **Compile-on-demand**: shell out to `burrow build` for just the new macro file and dynamically
     load the result (Go plugin (`.so`) or a small subprocess) — real, but `burrow`'s own emitted
     Go has never been loaded as a runtime plugin anywhere in this monorepo; unproven.
  2. **Interpret, don't compile**: DUNG carries a small runtime dispatcher over a `Vec Command`
     (command name + args) built directly from the recorded event stream, skipping PARENA
     compilation for playback entirely and reserving the emitted `.prn` file as the real,
     human-readable/editable *record* of the macro, not its execution path. Cheaper, doesn't need
     `burrow`'s still-missing Vec/loop/FFI support (per "Real risks" above) — recommended as the
     real Phase A, with path 1 revisited once `burrow` matures.
- **Gated the same way Phase 2 itself is gated**: recording only makes sense once there's a real
  buffer/command surface to record against (Phase 2, `buffer.prn` port) — this doesn't unblock
  ahead of that, and is realistically a Phase 4+ item, after TextMate/Spotlight/plugin-API land
  (those give macros something worth recording).

**Not done this pass**: no code. This is a scoping correction (right repo, right doc) plus a real,
named playback-mechanism decision point for whoever picks up Phase 4+ — the same "scoping now,
building later" discipline this doc's own Phase 3+ line already follows.

## Real acceptance test file, named ahead of the code that will need it

Founder real-time: "make sure we are testing with the backlog when we dev DUNG its big." Once any
real file-viewing/editor rendering exists (Phase 2+), `EMILY/BACKLOG.md` is the real, standing
stress-test file — genuinely huge (25000+ lines as of 2026-08-30, mixed-language, real, organic
growth, not a synthetic benchmark), and the same real file the founder's own "whatever the browser
is doing to make this file viewable is like cliutch it works so good" comment (and the raw
GitHub link that followed it) already names as the real bar to clear. Named here now so it isn't
forgotten once real rendering code exists to test it against.

## Real first PARENA entry attempt — real, precise boundary found (2026-08-30)

Founder real-time: "try to write the entry in parena." Checked burrow's own actual current
capability first (`BURROW/emit_c.go`'s own real v0: scalar I32/Bool/F64/String/Unit params,
if/else, the real binop table, nested calls — no `defstruct`/`defenum`/`match`/`loop`/FFI yet,
confirmed by reading `emit_c.go`/`emit_c_test.go` directly, not assumed) before attempting
anything ambitious. **Real, working, verified**: `parena/entry.prn` ports the two genuinely
scalar-only decision-logic pieces already living in `cmd/dung/main.go` — `split-size` (the
split-axis child-size arithmetic `layout()` uses for both `splitVertical`/`splitHorizontal`) and
`next-focus-index` (the wraparound arithmetic `nextFocus()` uses) — real PARENA source, `burrow
parse`/`analyze`/`build` all clean, the emitted C `gcc`-compiled and run against real assertions
matching `main.go`'s own real behavior (`split_size(1440,2)==719`, `next_focus_index(2,3,1)==0`
wrapping, etc.) — all pass. **Real, precise boundary found, not glossed over**: `parena/
rect_probe.prn` (a deliberate probe, not wired into `entry.prn`'s exports) defines a `Rect`
`defstruct` and a function using it — `burrow parse`/`analyze` both accept it fine (general
PARENA grammar/region rules apply to `defstruct` already), but `burrow build` fails at the exact
boundary: `emit_c: unsupported top-level form (v0 only understands defn, module, export,
import)`. Confirms precisely what the rest of the entrypoint (the `Rect`/pane/node structs, the
event loop, the SDL2 FFI boundary) needs before it can move to PARENA: `defstruct` support in
burrow's own C emitter specifically (parser/region already ready for it), then `match`/`loop`,
then FFI — not attempted here, named as real, scoped, later work for BURROW's own next phase, not
DUNG's to build unilaterally. See `BURROW/NORTHSTAR.md`'s own open-items list for the same finding
recorded on that side.

## Real Go mod wired in — the loop closes (2026-08-30)

Founder real-time: "continue adding to DUNG's parena work, we want to emit go with burrow" →
"once we get burrow basic stuff working of course." `BURROW`'s own Phase 6 (a real, native Go
emission target) shipped in response — the real, concrete host its own NORTHSTAR.md only had a
named candidate for (`GoblinFoxDragon`, not committed to) until now. `internal/burrowgen/
entry_gen.go` is the real, checked-in output of `burrow build parena/entry.prn -o internal/
burrowgen/entry_gen.go` (a `//go:generate` directive on `cmd/dung/main.go` documents the real
regenerate command) — `cmd/dung/main.go` now calls `burrowgen.SplitSize`/`burrowgen.
NextFocusIndex` directly, a real Go import, **no cgo/FFI boundary at all** — the exact real
advantage a native Go target has over the C target for a Go-hosted consumer like this one.
Verified real, not just wired: `go build`/`go vet`/`go test` clean (the existing `split_test.go`
suite now exercises the real burrow-emitted function transitively, not a hand-written stand-in),
a real `bazel build //...` clean (new `internal/burrowgen/BUILD.bazel`, `cmd/dung/BUILD.bazel`
updated), and the real SDL2 visor binary run under Xvfb — identical, correct rendering to before
the mod was wired in, both via plain `go build` and via the real Bazel artifact. This is the real
"mods first everything" loop closing for DUNG specifically: PARENA source is the actual source of
truth for this decision logic now, not just a parallel proof sitting next to hand-written Go.

## Real "write it in LO" investigation — a real prerequisite found, not built around (2026-09-03)

Founder, kanban priority queue: "CONTINUE WORKING ON DUNG IDE write it in LO." Investigated
concretely against `LO`'s own real, current compiler (`LO/internal/emitter/emitter.go`), not
assumed from memory of LO's earlier, narrower state. Two real, compounding gaps found — full
detail in `LO/NORTHSTAR.md`'s own mirrored "DUNG integration" section:

1. LO's own arithmetic is mod-4 (base4 state algebra) by design, not general integer arithmetic
   — genuinely can't express `split-size`/`next-focus-index`'s own real division/modulo over
   arbitrary pixel widths and pane counts. A narrower, honestly-4-state-shaped slice (e.g. which
   of Left/Right/Up/Down was pressed) could fit, in principle.
2. Even for that narrower case: `lo build`'s own compiled output is always a single,
   self-contained, zero-parameter computation over compile-time literals — there is no way today
   to emit a real, exported, runtime-callable function the way `parena/entry.prn`'s own
   `(defn ... ) (export ...)` (and this project's own `internal/burrowgen`, generated from it)
   already is. This blocks *any* LO integration into DUNG right now, not just the arithmetic-
   heavy pieces.

**Real, honest conclusion**: not attempted this pass. The concrete prerequisite (LO emitting a
real, parameterized, exported `defn` from a bare top-level `Lambda` instead of only supporting
an immediately-invoked one) is scoped in `LO/NORTHSTAR.md` but not built — a real compiler
feature deserving its own design/test pass, not a rushed patch under one kanban card's time
budget.

**Real, concrete unblock instead, same session**: founder, confirming the pivot — "ok write it
in parena and go? right? with burrow/." `BURROW`'s own `emit_c.go` gained real `defstruct`/
`get-field` support the same day (see `BURROW/CLAUDE.md`), closing the exact gap this project's
own `parena/rect_probe.prn` found live on 2026-08-30. `rect_probe.prn` itself updated and
re-verified: its ORIGINAL version (`(Rect (get r x) ...)`, constructing and returning a new
`Rect`) now fails with a real, honest `emit_c: unknown identifier 'Rect'` — confirmed live,
not silently miscompiled — because struct **construction** is deliberately still unsupported by
either `burrow` target (the same "receives, doesn't construct" scope `emit_go.go`'s own struct
support already committed to). Rewritten to the real, working slice instead: a struct
*parameter* plus a real `get-field` read, scalar return — `rect-left-child-width(r, border)`,
verified `burrow build` → real `gcc -Wall -Wextra` → run, correct result (710 for a 1440-wide
rect with a 20px border). **Real, current, narrower scope for DUNG's own Phase 2** (the
ground-up `stdlib/editor/buffer.prn` port): structs can now be passed in and read from, but any
real editor function that needs to CONSTRUCT and return a new struct (very plausibly common in
buffer/pane logic) still can't — a real, concrete design constraint for that phase's own next
scoping pass, narrower than the full `emit.c`-parity wait this doc originally named, but not a
full unblock either.

## Real risks and open questions, named honestly

- **DUNG's own PARENA editor-domain build is real, still gated on burrow's own struct/enum/match
  support landing** (see "Real first PARENA entry attempt" above for the precise, tested boundary)
  — not this project's own work to accelerate unilaterally.
- **Bazel rules mix**: this repo needs real C/Go/PARENA build integration (rules_cc-equivalent for
  any Go+cgo/SDL2 pieces, plus genrule-style steps invoking the real `burrow` binary against
  `.prn` source) — not yet designed at the `BUILD.bazel` level.
- **cgo linking against real PARENA-emitted output** (once `burrow build` can emit something,
  whatever target it lands on first — C is the most likely first real target, matching `parena-c`'s
  own default) needs the same real `parena_runtime.h`/`.c` bridging every other real PARENA-mod
  host in this monorepo already uses — real, proven pattern, not yet applied to a GUI/SDL2 host.
- **i3's own real tiling model is more general than DUNG strictly needs** (i3 manages whole
  windows/workspaces across an entire desktop session) — DUNG only needs the real CONTAINER-SPLIT
  primitive, not i3's own window-manager-level concerns.
- **No real acceptance bar named yet for DUNG** (unlike `BURROW`, which has the founder's own
  explicit "pass all that parena c tests" bar) — a real, open question for the next scoping pass.
- **The chat-pane's own real backend contract isn't specified yet** — presumably the same real
  `EMILY_AGENT_URL`/Emily Prime agent connection `PITVIPER/docs/NORTHSTAR.md`'s own Milestone 4
  already plans, but not confirmed for DUNG specifically; "load [a file] from internet" as a
  chat-context source has no real fetch/security model specified yet either.

- `BURROW` — this project's own real compiler toolchain dependency (`burrow build` compiles
  DUNG's own ground-up PARENA editor source); `BURROW/NORTHSTAR.md`'s own Phase 3-4 is a real,
  named prerequisite this project is gated on.
- `PITVIPER/CLAUDE.md`, `PITVIPER/docs/NORTHSTAR.md` — the real, existing terminal emulator DUNG
  rewrites (unaffected, stays as-is); its own Milestone 4 (Emily Prime pane) is the real precedent
  for DUNG's own new chat-pane feature.
- `PARENA/stdlib/editor/*.prn` — the real, existing editor logic this project ports, ground-up,
  into its own real `.prn` source tree; `PARENA/editor-demo` is the real, already-built proof this
  logic already compiles and runs (via `parena-c`, not yet via `burrow`).
- `EmilyOS/docs/legacy-archive/gui-v0.1-design-capture.md` — the real, already-written,
  authoritative UX/interaction spec this project adopts directly.
- `EmilyOS/internal/posture/` — the real posture state machine DUNG's own denial-feedback UX
  would need to read from for a real, live integration.
- `SAND` — the real precedent for "a new, separate fork of an existing mission, not a
  rewrite-in-place," applied here a second time (DUNG relative to `PITVIPER`).
